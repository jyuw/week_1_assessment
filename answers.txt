var = "variable"
num = 44

Question 4: Rspec
How do you initialize rspec in a folder?
run rspec --init on terminal
delete comments from spec_helper.rb
add --format documention and --format color to .rspec

We would ordinarily have written our tests first, then written code to make them pass. Why?
to make sure that each step is passing individually so we know which part is wrong
when we add something new
